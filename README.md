## How to run

The policy translator was developed and tested with Python version 2.7.

It can be executed using the command

``./policy_translator.py COMBO-FILE``

(the specified file must contain an inventory first, followed by policies)

or

``./policy_translator.py INVENTORY-FILE POLICY-FILE``

and export of reachability tables in HTML or CSV format can be toggled using the command-line options ``--html`` and ``--csv``.

## Example files

Two example files that contain both an inventory and policies are enclosed with the policy translator.
